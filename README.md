## Amazon Top 50 Bestselling Books (1982-2022) EDA
### ABOUT
#### Tableau is a data visualization tool, used to create dashboards and reports. Using Tableau, an exploratory data analysis was conducted on Amazon's Top 50 Bestselling books dataset. 
#### The primary objective of this project was to explore the functionality of Tableau and get familiar with its workings. The resulting dashboards can be viewed here: https://public.tableau.com/app/profile/abilehita.sarah.azamegbe/viz/AMAZONBESTSELLINGBOOKSVISUALIZATION/FictionandNon-FictionBooks?publish=yes
### PROCESS
#### The data was downloaded as a CSV file from kaggle.com and uploaded to Jupyter Notebook using the pandas.read_csv() command.
#### Basic data exploration and cleaning were done in the Jupyter environment before exporting the dataset in CSV format.
#### The data was then uploaded to Tableau for visualization and analysis. The result of the analysis can be found in this short Medium article: https://medium.com/@azamegbesarah/amazon-top-50-bestselling-books-analysis-b390cc81acef?_branch_match_id=1064648371784712689&_branch_referrer=H4sIAAAAAAAAA8soKSkottLXz8nMy9bLTU3JLM3VS87P1fdMcQotyvVLLitJAgCOv1ZlIwAAAA%3D%3D
